## Domain of Interest
### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
We are interested in the domain of Seattle Rental Rates because there have been new, luxury units flooding the market which have caused average rental prices to skyrocket. There is an issue of lack of affordable housing for low and middle income families across Seattle neighborhoods. Through  increased cost of living and gentrification, it creates pressure on middle and  low-income residents to find affordable housing.
